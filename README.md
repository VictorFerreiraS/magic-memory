In this version of the magic memory app I tranfosrmed the previus card state into a global state using react redux toolkit.
1- The global state can be viwed in the cards.js insidethe features folder;
2- The shuffleCard function was also modified t oattend to new global state;
3- The index.js was changed as standard for redux;
